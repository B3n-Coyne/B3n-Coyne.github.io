        "Communication during warfare has always been of the utmost importance, especially in military intelligence and counter-intelligence. As warfare has become more complex, so too has the information that must be passed around. With this increase in complexity, data processing and statistical techniques have become vital to make sense of the incoming data in order to use resources more efficiently and prevent unnessesary losses, not only of equipment but also of life."
